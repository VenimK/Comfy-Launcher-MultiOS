## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Black0S/Comfy-Launcher-MultiOS
cd Comfy-Launcher-MultiOS
```

### 2. Make scripts executable

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

### 3. Run the installer

```bash
./install.sh
```

You will be prompted to select:
- Your **operating system**
- Your **Python version** (3.12 / 3.13 / 3.14)

The installer will then:
- Check and install `git` if missing
- Check and install the selected Python version if missing
- Clone ComfyUI and ComfyUI-Manager
- Create a virtual environment
- Install PyTorch with the right backend (CUDA on Linux, MPS nightly on macOS)
- Install all ComfyUI dependencies

### 4. Launch ComfyUI

```bash
./launch.sh
```

Open your browser at: **http://127.0.0.1:8188**

## 🐍 Python Version Guide

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **3.12** | ⚠️ Older | Maximum compatibility with custom nodes |
| **3.13** | ✅ Recommended | Compatible with the vast majority of custom nodes |
| **3.14** | 🧪 Experimental | Some custom nodes may not work |

## 🔀 Switching Python Version

To switch the Python version used by ComfyUI without reinstalling everything from scratch:

```bash
./switchpy.sh
```

The script will:
- Display the **currently active Python version** (highlighted in yellow)
- Let you choose a new version
- Check and install it if not present on your system
- Delete the old virtual environment
- Recreate a clean one with the new Python version
- Reinstall PyTorch and all ComfyUI dependencies automatically

---

## 🔄 Updating

### Update ComfyUI

```bash
./update-comfyui.sh
```

Pulls the latest commits from the ComfyUI repository and updates all venv dependencies.

> ComfyUI-Manager updates itself from within the ComfyUI interface.

### Update PyTorch

```bash
./update-torch.sh
```

Reinstalls the latest version of PyTorch in the venv, for your OS and hardware.

---

## 📊 System Info

```bash
./info.sh
```

Displays a full diagnostic dashboard in the terminal:

- 🖥️ **System** — OS, kernel, CPU, RAM
- ⚡ **GPU / CUDA** — GPU name, VRAM, driver version, CUDA toolkit
- 🐍 **Python** — All versions installed on the system, with the ComfyUI venv version highlighted
- 🔥 **PyTorch** — Version, CUDA/MPS availability, GPU seen by PyTorch
- 🎨 **ComfyUI** — Branch, commit, date, ComfyUI-Manager status

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Linux
- `bash` 4.0+
- A package manager: `dnf`, `pacman`, or `apt`
- NVIDIA GPU with drivers installed *(recommended)*
- CUDA runtime *(optional — PyTorch works without `nvcc`)*

### macOS
- `bash` 4.0+ (`brew install bash` if needed)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- Apple Silicon recommended for MPS acceleration
